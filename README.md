Analytics for calculating the advertising budget of the federal mobile operator
Analytics for Megaline, a federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.
I had to do a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. I had the data of 500 Megalyne users at my disposal: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and conclude which tariff is better.
